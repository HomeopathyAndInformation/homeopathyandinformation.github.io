                            the treatment happens, or the lifestyle change is met or continued if need be.
                            <br>Most of my patients come to me as a last resort, after having been treated unsuccessfully by
                            classical medicine. Many were unaware that there’s a myriad of successful natural treatments
                            available. Most treatments are also complementary to general medical practices in North America.
