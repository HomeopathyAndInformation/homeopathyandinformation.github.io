        <h1>Questions and Answers</h1>
        <h2>1. Can I start my treatment before I am able to get my supplements and my homeopathic remedies?</h2>
        <p>Yes, you can start your given diet without delay and respect the food intolerance list recommended. Add <a href="./supplements.php">the supplements</a> and homeopathic remedies as soon as possible.</p>

        <h2>2. Can I start my treatment even if I do not have all the supplements and homeopathic remedies?</h2>
        <p>Yes, you can start with what you are able to get and add the missing items as soon as possible.</p>

        <h2>3. Does this program cause side effects?</h2>
        <p>In my 30 years of experience, I have noted that patients who follow the program rigorously, there ar eno side effects. However, very rarely parentis who follow the program rigourously, there are no side effects. However, very rarely patients experience some withdrawal symptoms, such as headache, fatique, aggravation of pain, and diarrhea due to the body adjusting itself to the new lifestyle. Patience is important, and if those symptoms exceed 48 hours, you may contact me. In this case, you stop the supplements and the homeopathy but not the diet.</p>

        <h2>4. Can I skip one day a week and eat whatever I want?</h2>
        <p>No, and the reason for that is that the regular food you consome in the past is the direct cause of your disease due to its contaminations with chemicals used during cultivation and animal feed. You can learn further that by accessing the reference page on the website and find the articles discussing this topic.</p>

        <h2>5. When can I resume my normal diet?</h2>
        <p>This program you are following is based on the wellbeing observed in thousands of my patients after they have tried to go back to their old habits of eating and the subsequent consequences (getting back their old symptoms). The reason for that is that every cell in your body carries the memory of the harmful toxins contributing to the malaise that you came to consult me about. Therefore, I strongly advise your strict adherence to the diet for one year, and then you can eat once or twice a month food items not contained in your list without any setback.</p>

        <h2>6. What are the substitutes for wheat?</h2>
        <p>Spel, Oat, Eye, Barley, Buckwheat, Millet, nonmodified Corn, Kamut, Sprouted Wheat, Einkorn, Quinoa, Brown Rice. In my experience, Spelt and Einkorn are very good grains to bake bread and cakes with. For people who like baking, almond flour works very well. All the byproducts containing these grains in their pure or combined form are the perfect substitutes for wheat.</p>

        <h2>7. What are the substitutes for cow milk and its byproducts?</h2>
        <p>You may use goat milk, sheep milk and their byproducts. If you do not like them, you may also use Almond, Oat, Hazelnut, and Coconut milk.</p>

        <h2>8. What are the subsittutes for white sugar?</h2>
        <p>Organic cane sugar, red beet molasses, maple syrup, honey, pure Stevia.</p>

        <h2>9. Where do I find the alternative food products?</h2>
        <p>You will find plenty of food items in your local health shops, in the isles of organic and healthy food items in all supermarkets, and online.</p>

        <h2>10. How do I know that the food supllements and homeopathic products I buy are genuine?</h2>
        <p>In the reference section of the website, you will find a list of brands that are recommended by the Consumer Lab Report. This entity is the most reliable source to verify the authenticity of a product. Regarding Homeopathy, you will find a list of the best companies of homeopathic products in the world.</p>

        <h2>11. Can I stop my classical medication?</h2>
        <p>You must go back to your physician and coordinate the withdrawal of your classical medication. <span>You cannot stop your medication by yourself without the supervision of the physician who prescribed it for you.</span></p>

        <h2>12. If my physician does not want to support me on this journey, what do I do?</h2>
        <p><span>You cannot stop your by yourself medication without the supervision of the physician who prescribed it for you.</span> I recommend that you find a physician who is cooperative and open-minded to alternative medicine to help you to withdraw. As a homepath, I do not have the authority to advise you regarding the withdrawal from classical medication.</p>
