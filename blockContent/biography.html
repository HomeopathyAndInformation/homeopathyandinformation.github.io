        <h1>Who is Practitioner of Holistic Medicine, Aboudi Merhi?</h1>
        <section>
            <div><img src="../images/aboudy_bandana_1.jpg"></div>
            <p>My name is Abdul-Razzak Merhi. Friends and family call me Aboudi, as do many of my patients. I
            am a Canadian Lebanese, living peacefully in British Columbia with my family. Born in 1958 in the
            historical town of Tripoli in the north of Lebanon, I mainly attended French boarding schools where
            I was exposed to a mix of European and Arab curriculum and culture. The onset of the Lebanese
            civil war in 1975 changed the path of my life forever.</p>

        </section>
        
        <section>
            
            <p>I had been working as a volunteer for the Lebanese Red Cross while attending school when war
            broke out. At the age of seventeen, the International Red Cross hired me to work as a translator
            in Arabic and French, and join the frontline workers on their missions across the country serving many
            different communities. Having consciously rejected armed conflict, I still had to learn to cope with
            being a witness to horrific war scenes and collecting the injured and the dead. I sometimes had to
            assist in emergency operations where I was trained on the spot. In retrospect, the time spent with
            these extraordinary doctors endangering their lives for the simple purpose of doing good, saving
            lives, and healing, paved the way for my future. It was then that I decided to dedicate myself to the
            betterment of humankind and become involved in creating peace and tolerance among communities
            in strife.</p>

            <div><img src="../images/merhi_family3.jpeg" alt="Aboudi's Children"></div>
            <p class="lefting">Ultimately, the violence forced me to leave my homeland in autumn of 1976, transitioning to
            Cyprus and then to Canada, where I became a Canadian Citizen, and trained to become a
            practitioner of health and wellness of people. The move also began my search for my place in
            western culture. While I studied science and psychology at Universite de Montreal, I also began
            founding an organization to help new immigrants from Lebanon settle in Canada. We created
            liaisons with other cultural groups with people from war-torn countries seeking refuge in Canada.
            During this time, I had the opportunity to work with midwives and began pondering the path of
            alternative medicine. I also met my German wife while I was young; we got married in Canada and
            began our family of four children. Their love and support are my life-anchor to this day.</p>

            <p class="lefting">After settling down in 1985, my career as a homeopathic practitioner truly began. I enrolled in the 
                <span class="bio-focus">Le Centre de Techniques Homéopathiques de Montréal</span> (the center for homeopathic techniques in Montreal) 
                and graduated  from there in 1990. I also attended the <span class="bio-focus">École Supérieure de Médicine Chinoise de Montréal</span> 
                (the Superior School of Chinese medicine in Montreal). I am one of the founders and a current member of the Syndicat professionnel 
                des homeopathes du Quebec, <span class="bio-focus">SPHQ</span> (the Syndicate of Homeopathic Professionals in Quebec). I have recently become a member of <span class="bio-focus">the British Columbia Homeopathic 
                Association (BCHA)</span> as well. But, let's go back to how I got here...</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <div><img src="../images/bonding2.jpeg"></div>
            <p>After the war in Lebanon finally ended, my family and I decided to return there in 1993 to introduce
            homeopathy as a <span class="bio-focus">complementary medicine</span> to the Middle East. I joined the clinic of Dr. Karam
            Karam, an osteopath, in Beirut, and worked there until 2021, when we returned to Canada. I had
            opened my own clinic further north to service patients in that area. It was challenging to deal with
            extreme illnesses and health issues which I had not seen in the west.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <div><img src="../images/sunset.jpeg"></div>
            <p>The road was rich. My journey has culminated in a portfolio of 10,000+ patients. I consistently
            attended classes and conferences on a yearly basis in Germany and Europe. Over the years, I have
            learned to combine homeopathy with naturopathy, vitamin therapy and Mora therapy. In addition,
            advocating environmental solutions to a patient’s lifestyle has become a very important aspect of
            my practice. Combining complementary natural methods means I can find a unique solution to your
            dis-ease, based on your specific condition.<a href="../consultation.php">Please book now.</a></p>
