                    <p class="t-text">I am actually kinda’ proud to be one of Aboudi’s original five crash test dummies so to speak,
meaning I volunteered to be one of his first five test patients when he was a student of
homeopathic medicine, and one of seven graduate students (including his wife Andy) sharing a
huge apartment in Montreal, in 1985. We were nicknamed the “UN” by our friends, as it was
common to hear French, Arabic and English in single of multiple conversations in the kitchens,
halls and living rooms. Aboudi’s core interest, even back then, was to help people feel better.
He has literally saved my life once. He enlightened me to a potassium deficiency before I knew
what the word meant, let alone the fact it’s an essential mineral to stay alive, and where to find
it in food, drink and supplements. It is hard to summarize my respect and admiration for Aboudi
as a friend and practitioner who has changed the way I think about life in general, and my own
body as living organism, more specifically. I am thrilled to be able to contribute as a volunteer
to this website with original photos and videos, and as its Content Editor as a way of giving
back, and paying my eternal gratitude forward.</p>

                    <p class="t-text">In 2012, I had been diagnosed with renal failure which required either dialysis or kidney
replacement. It was considered ‘too late’ to check for alternatives, by no less than three major
specialized centers, which all gave the same bleak prognosis—but I was refusing to surrender.
Just two days before the first dialysis session, I visited Hp. Merhi.
Luckily for me, he checked me out with the MORA equipment, which provided a very hopeful
analysis: going deep to the root causes, and dealing with them, could cure and save the kidney.
As an old believer and user of alternative medicine, I took this opportunity to heart, especially
to avoid dialysis.
Hp. Merhi started me on a new path, with a regulated food menu and homeopathic treatment
that helped greatly. My ‘renal failure’ was reversed, and my kidneys recovered in a short period
(2 months).
The real upside to the kidney kerfuffle was that I got into a long-term friendship, with a trustful
resource, and caring professional practitioner. A double win.
Hp. Merhi is always available when I need him. I get an annual check-up of course, but I do see
him many times per year, because also I accompany my referred friends to his office!</p>

                    <p class="t-title">LEBANON</p>
                    <p class="t-text">Hp. Merhi opened an amazing horizon for me. He is sincere. He takes things seriously,
and scientifically. He finds which treatments are best for his individual patients. He is
always improving his knowledge of the latest discoveries in alternative medicine.
Thanks to Hp. Merhi, my life is no longer controlled by a “weight problem”.
My name is Abed Ghaleb, and I am a 37-year-old Lebanese entrepreneur with my own
management consulting company.
My journey started with Hp. Merhi back in 2019, when I weighed 128 kgs. Only 18
months later, I had lost 50+ kilos, and achieved my ideal weight of 79.5 kgs. It will soon
be 2023, and I’m still maintaining that ideal weight, by practicing the changes in lifestyle
and diet that Hp. Merhi taught me. Here’s what happened.
Two days before meeting Hp. Merhi, I was trying to tie my shoes, but I couldn’t reach
my shoelaces. That was the “Aha” moment, where I said to myself: “the time for change
has come! I am still in my 30s, and I won’t let myself down dramatically, nor go to a
place of no return’.”
I began searching for a natural solution. I didn’t seek a fast one, because I only wanted
to get back to looking like a ‘normal’ person. Time was not the issue, so a friend of
mine, familiar with my frustrating situation, introduced me to the concept of homeopathy,
and Mr. Merhi. “See what he recommends,” said the friend, so I decided it would be
worth a try. (Back then, I also didn’t have any knowledge of how my body works, nor on
the roles of glands, vitamins, minerals and more in our overall wellness, but more on
that later.)
My first visit to Hp. Merhi was amazingly informative. He spent around 2.5 hours with
me in total, including my diagnosis, using a bio-resonance machine. He started by
explaining to me how my body functions, and how one’s overall energy is related to
wellness. He recommended a strict plan for me to follow, including supplements,
homeopathic treatment and stressed the importance of abiding by the plan. Up until that
day, I was only concerned about losing weight, but I followed the entire plan.
After only few weeks into The Plan, I started noticing great changes in my overall
energy and wellness, as well as the expected loss of body weight. I started to believe
that slow change would work best, especially after 15 years of food abuse, neglect and
bad lifestyle habits. Mr. Merhi warned me to not expect results overnight, so I didn’t.
My second appointment with Hp. Merhi showed great progress, with healing results, so I
continued to abide by The Plan for months, and my body kept improving on all levels.
This opened up a whole new world to me.

I am curious by nature, so with the additional guidance of Mr. Merhi, I began
researching my own health: how organs and glands work, how vitamins and minerals
benefit, the best time to eat, the best way to sleep, and health factors.
My new belief in this natural healing system helped me lose some 50 kgs, without any
damage in any body function. In addition, my body fully healed from toxins. I even got
rid of my reading glasses, as I no longer needed them while reading.
So, you see my story is not just about weight loss. It’s about living a better life. It’s about
learning to read the needs of my own body. It has been about listening to what Mr.
Merhi taught me about how to live a healthy life and applying it to my daily routine.
I will always consult Hp. Merhi when I need his wisdom guidance to get or keep me well,
but today I know how to apply some of his wisdom to become my own healer and
doctor, which is also his own personal goal, which is to have his patients be able to care
for themselves. A great catch!
I genuinely recommend Hp. Merhi to anyone who is searching to become a better
version of themselves, no matter what age they are. My own parents have visited Hp.
Merhi, and now they too have started their own journey of healthy change. You can too.</p>

                    <p class="t-text">Our journey with HP Merhi, began back in 2003. I was 24 at the time and battling many illnesses. A long
history of misdiagnosis and wrong treatments, I was depleted from health on all levels. Hp. Merhi,
accurately diagnosed and pinned the problems that I had and put me on the right road to health. Since
following his regimen and his homeopathic treatment I am healthy and was able to conceive a healthy
child. If I am to go into details as to how many times Hp. Merhi saved my family from all, I would overtake
all testimonies. But to sum it up:
Hp. Merhi is superiorly knowledgeable in all aspects of healthy living. His diagnosis is accurate! He is
truthful and trustworthy. He is a practitioner with ethics and morals. His Homeopathic holistic treatment
approach, combining physical, mental, spiritual and environmental, encompassing all, is exceeding all
conventional medicine.
 We are forever grateful to Hp. Merhi.</p>

                    <p class="t-text">Abdul Merhi guided me with precious advice, using Mora Therapy, and showed me how to take
care of my health, through a different perspective, without blindly following allopathic
traditional medicine. This saved me from many health issues that we all go through…
 
I followed up with routine medical check-ups. I asked Mr. Merhi to advise me on the diagnosis,
and asked him to replace ‘chemical medication’ with homeopathic treatments, natural food
supplements, and the vitamins my body really needed. This method helped me solve problems
like hypothyroidism, menopause weight gain, and many other issues which were cured (instead
of them becoming permanent illnesses and me becoming enslaved to daily medical or
hormonal pill, intake treatments).
 
I am now also healthier because I avoid highly processed foods, and instead seek homeopathic
alternatives and supplements to complement my diet.
 
Today I know my body can heal itself when given the right nutrients. Now I understand my body
is always meant to be in good health, and never sick!</p>
