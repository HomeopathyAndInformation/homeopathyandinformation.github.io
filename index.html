                        missions across the country serving  different communities. ejec armed conflict, I had to learn to cope being a witness 
                        to horrific scenes and collecting the injured and the dead. I sometimes had to assist in emergency operations where I was 
                        trained on the spot. In retrospect, the time spent with these extraordinary doctors endangering their lives for the simple 
                        purpose of doing good, saving lives, and healing the way for my future. I decided to dedicate my to better humankind and
